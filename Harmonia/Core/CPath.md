# CPath

CPath is a class for manipulating file system paths.

## Methods

### __construct

Constructs a new instance.

Leading and trailing whitespace are trimmed when storing the specified
path value.

#### Syntax

```php
public function __construct(string|\Stringable $value = '')
```

#### Parameters

- **$value**: (Optional) The path value to store. If omitted, defaults to an empty string. If given a `CPath` instance, its value is copied. For a `Stringable` instance, its string representation is used, and for a native string, the value is used directly.

---

### Join

Joins multiple path segments into a single path.

#### Syntax

```php
public static function Join(string ...$segments): \Harmonia\Core\CPath
```

#### Parameters

- **$segments**: A list of path segments to join.

#### Return Value

A new `CPath` instance representing the joined path.

---

### EnsureLeadingSlash

Ensures the path starts with a leading slash.

If the path does not already start with a slash, one is inserted at the
beginning.

This method directly modifies the current instance.

#### Syntax

```php
public function EnsureLeadingSlash(): self
```

#### Return Value

The current instance.

---

### EnsureTrailingSlash

Ensures the path ends with a trailing slash.

If the path does not already end with a slash, one is appended at the
end.

This method directly modifies the current instance.

#### Syntax

```php
public function EnsureTrailingSlash(): self
```

#### Return Value

The current instance.

---

### TrimLeadingSlashes

Removes all leading slashes.

Leading slashes include both forward slashes and backslashes depending on
the operating system.

This method directly modifies the current instance.

#### Syntax

```php
public function TrimLeadingSlashes(): self
```

#### Return Value

The current instance.

---

### TrimTrailingSlashes

Removes all trailing slashes.

Trailing slashes include both forward slashes and backslashes depending
on the operating system.

This method directly modifies the current instance.

#### Syntax

```php
public function TrimTrailingSlashes(): self
